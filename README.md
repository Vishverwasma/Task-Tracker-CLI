# Task Tracker CLI Project

## Project Description( https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker )
The **Task Tracker** is a command line interface (CLI) application designed to help you track and manage tasks. This project allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, as well as track the progress of each task. It provides a simple way to list tasks based on their status (e.g., todo, in-progress, done) and stores the task data in a JSON file. 

This project helps practice programming skills such as working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a CLI application.

## Features
- **Add tasks**: Create new tasks with a description and an initial status.
- **Update tasks**: Modify existing tasks, including their description and status.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark tasks**: Change the status of tasks (e.g., todo, in-progress, done).
- **List tasks**: Display all tasks, tasks that are done, tasks that are in progress, and tasks that are not done.

## Task Properties
Each task in the application has the following properties:
- **id**: A unique identifier for each task.
- **description**: A short description of the task.
- **status**: The current status of the task (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **createdAt**: The date and time when the task was created.
- **updatedAt**: The date and time when the task was last updated.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used for the application logic.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework to structure the application and handle user input.
- **MySQL**: Used for persistent data storage.
- **JSON File**: Stores task data in the local file system if a database is not used.
  
## Requirements
- Java 8 or above installed
- MySQL Server installed and configured
- Spring Boot and Maven installed

## Constraints
- The application accepts user actions and inputs as command-line arguments.
- Tasks are stored in a JSON file in the current working directory if MySQL is not used.
- No external libraries are used for file handling.
- The JSON file is created automatically if it doesnâ€™t exist.
